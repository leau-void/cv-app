## About The Project

This CV Builder App makes out-of-the-box, ready CVs, so you can now land your dream job!

Your CV is displayed as it is being built, and when ready, it can be downloaded.

The app was written in React classes at first, and then refactored to be completely functional components, using React Hooks, to practice using both of these component types.
